Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at the moment whencontrolhasbeentransferredtothecustomerand ismeasurednetoftradediscounts,rebatesandpricing allowances to customers (collectively ‘trade spends’). There is a risk that revenue may be overstated because of fraud, resulting from the pressure local management may feel to achieve performance targets. Revenue is also an important element of how the company measures its performance, upon which management is incentivized. The Company focuses on revenue as a key performance measure, which could create an incentive for revenue to be recognized before control has been transferred.

Provision for contingencies (as described in Note 2, 35 and 41 to the financial statements)		
The management is required to make judgements and estimates in relation to the issues and exposures arising from a range of matters relating to direct tax, indirect tax, claims, general legal proceedings and other eventualities arising in the regular course of business. The Company is also subject to complexities arising from uncertain tax positions on deductibility of expenses. The key judgement lies in determining the likelihood and magnitude of an unfavorable outcome and interpretations of the legal aspects, tax legislations and judgements previously made by authorities. By nature, these are complex and include many variables.	Our audit procedures included the following: •Wetestedthedesign,implementationandoperating effectivenessofkeyinternalcontrolsaroundthe recognition and measurement of provisions. •We inquired the status in respect of significant provisions with the Company’s internal tax and legal team. •Weinvolvedoursubjectmatterexperts,wherever required, to assess the value of provisions in light of the nature of the exposures, applicable regulations and related correspondence with the authorities. •We challenged the assumptions and critical judgements made by the Company which impacted their estimate of provisionrequired,consideringjudgementspreviously made by the authorities in the relevant jurisdictions or any relevant opinions given by the Company’s advisors and assessing whether there was an indication of management bias.
