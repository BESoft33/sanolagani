Some of the proposals, which are initiated for implementation during 2023 at different factory locations are  as hereunder: •Use of biomass for steam generation; •Investments in improving plant efficiencies for generation as well as usage; •Investments in the solar energy by entering into Solar Power Purchase Agreement (PPA); •Investment in second stage Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant to increase recovery; and •Investment in other renewable energy sources. (c)Impact of the measures at (a) and (b) above for reduction of energy consumption and consequent impact on the cost of production of goods: During the years, at the factories there have been continuous efforts to improve operational efficiencies, minimizing consumption of natural resources and reducing water, energy and CO2 emissions while maximizing production volumes. As a result, during the period from 2007 to 2022, for every ton of production, the Company has reduced, the usage of energy by around 36%, water usage by around 51%, generation of waste water by around 38% and specific direct greenhouse gas emissions by around 52%. (d)Projects planned or initiated for further improvement in energy and water consumption are: Continuous Energy initiatives at different factory locations: •Use of biomass for steam generation; •Plant efficiency improvement for generation as well as usage; and •Additional Solar Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Continuous Water Initiatives at different factory locations: •Investment in second stage Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant to increase recovery; and •Increase recycling of Effluent Treatment after polishing through RO plant. Continuous Initiatives to reduce Green House Gases (GHG) emissions at different factory locations: The Company plans to reduce around 130,000 Tons of GHG in next two to three years. Some of the key renewable energy projects that contributed to reduction in GHG emissions are: •Contribution by improving energy generation efficiency; and •Addition of solar energy capacities and increase in share of green power in purchased electricity. B.TECHNOLOGY ABSORPTION Efforts made in technology absorption are furnished below: Research and Development (R&D): 1. Specific areas in which R&D carried out by the Company Your Company, as a part of Nestlé Group and under the General License Agreements, has access to and advantage of drawing from the extensive central R&D efforts and activities of the Nestlé Group. The R&D organization of Nestlé Group has over 4100 R&D experts across more than 23 facilities worldwide and Nestlé Group invests over CHF 1.7 Billion every year. It is uniquely placed to advance purpose driven innovation across all product categories of your Company or elsewhere around the world. R&D organisation has an extensive infrastructure and state-of -the-art facilities along with broad and deep expertise in plant science, food science, nutrition, food safety, culinary matters, regulatory matters, manufacturing and packaging. Nestlé Group, therefore, provides an access to its unique ability to discover, develop, innovate and renovate products and solution that are produced with careful consideration for natural resources and social impacts, contributing towards advancing re-generative food systems at scale while ensuring quality and safety of products. It has therefore been possible for your Company to focus its efforts on testing and modification of products for local conditions. Improving and maintaining the quality of certain key raw materials also continued to receive close attention. 178
