</p>
<p><b>2.13 Basis of Accounting for Investment in Associates      
</b></p>
<p>NAS 28 mentions that an entity with joint control of, or significant influence over, an 
</p>
<p>investee shall account for its investment in an associate or a joint venture using the 
</p>
<p>equity method. Further, the standard clarifies that significant influence is the power to

<p>control or joint control of those policies.  The Bank's investment in National Productivity 
</p>

</p>
<p>entities. These investments were made under the specific directives or policies of the

<p>significant influence on the entities except for regulatory purposes. As the requirement 
</p>
<p>of NAS 28- Investments in Associates for being the associates of the bank does not meet, 
</p>
<p>the equity accounting for such investment has not been done. These investments are

<p><b>2.14 Changes in Accounting Policies 
</b></p>
<p>The bank has applied its accounting policies consistently except for the following two 
</p>
<p>cases. The changes in accounting policies have been applied retrospectively as per the 
</p>
<p>requirement of NAS 8: &#8220;Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
</p>
<p>Errors&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b>A) Accounting of allowances for expected credit loss 
</b></p>
<p>The bank had recognized the allowances for impairment based on Incurred Loss model 
</p>
<p>as per the requirement of NAS 39: Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
</p>
<p>Measurement. During the year, the bank has changed its accounting policy to 
</p>
<p>recognize allowance for impairment based on Expected Credit Loss model as per the 
</p>
<p>requirement of NFRS 9: Financial Instruments. The change in models of accounting for 
</p>
<p>allowances for impairment has resulted into the changes in accounting policy and has 
</p>
<p>been required by NFRS 9. 
</p>
<p><b>B) Measurement of Right of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities  
</b></p>
<p>The bank had recognized lease payment to operating lease to Statement of Net 
</p>

<p><b>i)  Recognition      
</b></p>
<p>The Bank initially recognizes loans and advances, deposit with other bank, 
</p>
<p>investment in securities on the date of which the bank becomes a party to the 
</p>
<p>instruments. All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases 
</p>
<p>and sales of financial assets) are recognized on the trade date which is the date 
</p>
<p>on which the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
</p>
<p>instruments. 
</p>
<p><b>ii)  Classification and measurement     </b>  
</p>
<p>The classification and measurement of financial assets will depend on how these 
</p>
<p>are managed (the entity&#8223;s business model) and their contractual cash flow 
</p>
<p>characteristics. These factors determine whether the financial assets are 
</p>
<p>measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income 
</p>
<p>(&#8222;FVTOCI&#8223;) or fair value through profit or loss (&#8222;FVTPL&#8223;).     
</p>
<p><b><i>The Bank classifies its financial assets into one of the following 
</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>categories:

</p>
<p>solely payment of principal and interest only. Financial assets measured at 
</p>
<p>amortized cost are initially recognized at fair value plus any transaction 
</p>
<p>cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, such financial assets are measured at 
</p>
<p>amortized cost using effective interest rate method less any impairment 
</p>
<p>losses.  
</p>
<p><b>Following financial instruments are measured at amortized cost:  
</b></p>
<p><b>a) Cash in hand and balance with banks      
</b></p>
<p>Cash in hand and balance with banks includes notes and unrestricted 
</p>
<p>balances held with banks domiciled domestically and at abroad. This also 
</p>
<p>includes balances at current account of foreign central banks and Bank 
</p>
<p>for International Settlement. These balances are measured at amortized 
</p>
<p>cost and the transaction amount is the initial fair value of the asset. 
</p>
<p>There is no any transaction cost on these balances and interest income if 
</p>
<p>any on bank balances is recognized at effective interest rate. The Bank

<p><b>D. Amortized cost measurement:      
</b></p>
<p>The 'amortized cost' of a financial asset and financial liability is the amount at which 
</p>
<p>the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition, minus 
</p>
<p>principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective 
</p>

</p>
<p>maturity amount minus any reduction for impairment.  
</p>
<p><b>E. Fair value measurement:     
</b></p>
<p>The Bank measures financial instruments, such as, investment in equity instrument, 
</p>
<p>at fair value at each reporting date. The fair values of financial instruments measured 
</p>
<p>at amortized cost are disclosed in Note 5.6.4 
</p>
<p>Fair value of a financial instrument is the amount for which an asset could be 
</p>
<p>exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties at an arm&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>length transaction. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the 
</p>
<p>transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place in the principal 
</p>
<p>market. Quoted market values represent fair value when a financial instrument is 
</p>
<p>traded in an organized and liquid market. Where quoted market values are not 
</p>
<p>available, fair values are estimated by other techniques such as discounted cash 
</p>
<p>flows. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the 
</p>
<p>financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as 
</p>
<p>follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
</p>
<p>measurement as a whole:  
</p>
<p>Level 1 &#8212;  Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical 
</p>
<p>assets or liabilities  
</p>
<p>Level 2 &#8212;  Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is 
</p>
<p>significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly 
</p>
<p>observable.  
</p>
<p>Level 3 &#8212;  Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is 
</p>
<p>significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

<p>The Bank measures loss allowances at an amount equal to 12 months ECL for Stage 1 
</p>
<p>financial instruments. Stage 1 financial instruments include financial assets which are 
</p>
<p>not due or due for up to 30 days as well as assets which are in investment grade i.e. 
</p>
<p>sovereign and other investment grade rated assets. Life time loss allowance is

</p>
<p>instruments&#8221;. Stage 2 financial instruments includes asset which are past due for 
</p>
<p>more than 30 days but up to 90 days. Stage 2 financial instruments also include assets 
</p>
<p>which are referred to non investment grade investment. Life time ECL is also 
</p>
<p>measured for credit impaired assets which is referred to as &#8220;Stage 3 financial 
</p>
<p>instruments&#8221; A financial asset is &#8220;credit-impaired&#8221; when one or more events that 
</p>
<p>have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset 
</p>
<p>have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit impaired includes the 
</p>
<p>following observable data:  
</p>
<p>- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;  
</p>
<p>- the assets is past due for more than 90 days or a breach of contract such as 
</p>
<p>a default;  
</p>
<p>-  it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other 
</p>
<p>financial reorganization 
</p>
<p><b>Measurement of allowances for expected credit loss 
</b></p>
<p>The Bank uses &quot;internal default experience&quot; method for measurement of allowances 
</p>
<p>for expected credit loss. For the financial assets on which there is no any default 
</p>
<p>history, allowance for expected credit loss is measuring by adopting &quot;mapping to 
</p>
<p>external data&quot; method. The mechanism of the ECL calculations is outlined below with 
</p>
<p>the key elements.  
</p>
<p>- <b>Exposure at Default:  
</b></p>
<p>The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date. 
</p>
<p>The exposure at default includes principal amount and interest receivable. The 
</p>
<p>committed amount of investment is also included in exposure at default.  
</p>
<p>- <b>Probability of Default (PD):</b>  
</p>
<p>The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given 
</p>
<p>time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed 
</p>
<p>period. The Bank considers a particular obligor has defaulted in any of following

<p>- The bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to 
</p>
<p>the banking group in full, without recourse by the bank to actions such as

<p>realizing security if any held.  
</p>
<p>The Bank uses credit rating specific PD&#8223;s of issuers/counterparties from S&amp;P for 
</p>
<p>all its foreign investments amortized cost. Sovereign credit rating is used for 
</p>
<p>central bank, foreign government and bank for international settlement. PD's for 
</p>
<p>local currency is calculated based on default history. In the absence of default 
</p>
<p>history, a floor rate for PD is used as backstop. 
</p>
<p>- <b>Loss Given Default (LGD):

<p>The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a

</p>
<p>realization of any collateral. The Bank determines LGD for local assets based on

<p>Loans and debt securities are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no 
</p>
<p>reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion 
</p>
<p>thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does 
</p>
<p>not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to 
</p>
<p>repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the

</p>
<p>-  The assets or liabilities are managed, evaluated and reported internally on a fair

<p><b>iv.  Depreciation   
</b></p>
<p>Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over 
</p>
<p>its useful life. Depreciable amount is the cost of an asset, or other amount 
</p>
<p>substituted for cost, less its residual value. Land is not depreciated. All other 
</p>
<p>property, plant and equipment are depreciated from immediate next month of the 
</p>
<p>date they are available for use or in respect of self-constructed assets, from the 
</p>
<p>date that the construction is completed and ready for use. Similarly, while 
</p>
<p>disposing any depreciable asset, the depreciation is charged till the immediate 
</p>
<p>preceding month from the date of disposal. 
</p>
<p>Depreciation is charged on straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 
</p>
<p>current and comparative years of significant items of property, plant and 
</p>
<p>equipment. The Bank estimates the useful life and residual value of the depreciable 
</p>
<p>assets. Since the bank does not have any intention to sell or dispose the items of 
</p>
<p>Property, Plant and Equipment before the expiry of their useful life, the residual

<p><b><i>Financial Risk Management&#8211;Overview</i> 
</b></p>
<p>Risk Management Framework 
</p>
<p>The Bank's Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and 
</p>
<p>oversight of the Bank&#8223;s Risk Management Framework. The Board of Directors has formed 
</p>
<p>the Risk Management Committee, which is responsible for developing and monitoring the 
</p>
<p>Bank's risk management policies. The committee reports regularly to the Board of 
</p>
<p>Directors about its activities.  
</p>
<p>The Bank's risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risk 
</p>
<p>faced by the Bank, set appropriate risk limits and control, and monitor risks and 
</p>
<p>adherence to the limit. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to 
</p>
<p>reflect the changes in market conditions and the Bank's activities. The Bank through its 
</p>
<p>training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and 
</p>
<p>constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and 
</p>
<p>obligations. 
</p>
<p>The Bank&#8223;s Audit Committee oversees how the management monitors compliance with 
</p>
<p>the Bank&#8223;s risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the 
</p>
<p>risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Bank. The Audit 
</p>
<p>Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit Department. Internal Audit 
</p>
<p>Department undertakes both regular and ad hoc review of risk management controls and 
</p>
<p>procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>The Bank has exposure to the following risk arising from financial instruments 
</p>
<p>A. Credit Risk 
</p>
<p>B. Liquidity Risk 
</p>
<p>C. Market Risk 
</p>
<p><b>5.6.1. Credit Risk</b> 
</p>
<p>Credit Risk is risk of financial loss to a party if a customer or counterparty to a financial 
</p>
<p>instrument fails to meet its contractual obligation. The Bank's credit risk in relation to a 
</p>
<p>financial instrument is the risk that its customer or counter party fails to discharge its 
</p>
<p>obligation in accordance with agreed terms and cause the Bank to incur a financial loss. 
</p>
<p>The Bank's credit risk arises principally from the Bank's investment securities and 
</p>
<p>receivable from customers. The credit risk in the bank's foreign exchange reserve is 
</p>
<p>monitored and reviewed by using credit limits based on credit ratings by international 
</p>
<p>rating agency. 
</p>

<p><b>5.6.3. Market Risk 
</b></p>
<p>Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, 
</p>
<p>interest rates and equity prices and other assets prices may affect the Bank&#8223;s income or 
</p>
<p>the value of its holding of financial instruments. Market risk arises from open position in 
</p>
<p>interest rates, currency and equity products all of which are exposed to general and 
</p>
<p>specific market movement and changes in the level of volatility of the market rates or 
</p>
<p>interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The objective of market risk 
</p>
<p>management is to manage and control market risk exposure within the acceptable 
</p>
<p>parameters, while optimizing the return.  
</p>
<p><b>5.6.3.1. Currency Risk:</b> 
</p>
<p>Currency risk is the risk, where the value of financial instruments may fluctuate due to 
</p>
<p>changes in foreign exchange rates. Foreign currency activities result mainly from the 
</p>
<p>Bank's holding of foreign currency assets under its foreign exchange reserves management 
</p>
<p>function. The investment committee reviews the currency composition of the reserve and 
</p>
<p>monitors the Bank's compliance with the limits established for foreign currency positions 
</p>
<p>by the board. The major holding of foreign currency assets are denominated in USD, 
</p>
<p>CNY,CAD,JPY,AUD, GBP, EURO and INR. 
</p>
<p>The summary quantitative data about the Bank's exposure to currency risk at the reporting 
</p>
<p>period was as follows:

<p>A strengthening (weakening) of USD, AUD, EUR, GBP, CNY, CAD, SDR, JPY and SAR against

<p>by the amount shown below. This analysis is based on foreign exchange rate variances

<p><b>5.6.3.3. Interest Rate Risk:</b> 
</p>
<p>Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of financial assets will fluctuate due to changes 
</p>
<p>in market interest rate. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows 
</p>
<p>of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Fair 
</p>
<p>value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
</p>
<p>because of changes in market interest rates.  
</p>
<p>The Bank takes on exposure to the effects of fluctuations in the prevailing levels of 
</p>
<p>market interest rates on both its fair value and cash flow risks. Interest margins may 
</p>
<p>increase as a result of such changes but may reduce losses in the event that unexpected 
</p>
<p>movements arise. The Board sets limits on the level of mismatch of interest rate re-
</p>
<p>pricing which is monitored daily by the Bank Treasury. 
</p>
<p>The Bank has kept substantial investments on short-term loans thereby controlling the 
</p>
<p>interest rate risk to significant extent. The interest rate profile of the interest-bearing

<p><b>5.6.5.   Fair Value Hierarchy 
</b></p>
<p>Fair value measurements have been classified using a &quot;fair value hierarchy&quot; that 
</p>
<p>categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value 
</p>
<p>hierarchy has three different levels and gives the highest priority to quoted (unadjusted) 
</p>
<p>prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The different 
</p>
<p>levels are defined as follows. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Level 1 input are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and 
</p>
<p>liabilities the entity can access at the measurement date.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that 
</p>
<p>are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, quoted prices for 
</p>
<p>similar assets or liabilities in active markets. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>All the financial assets are measured at amortized cost except for the equity 
</p>
<p>investment-which has been recognized at fair value through other comprehensive 
</p>
<p>income. The details showing the carrying amounts of financial assets that are measured

<p><b>5.7. Employees Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans 
</b></p>
<p>The Bank currently offers two defined benefit post-employment plans to its employees, 
</p>
<p>based on length of service and amount of compensation. These post-employment benefits 
</p>
<p>plans are &#8222;Gratuity or Pension Plan&#8223; and &#8222;Staff Security Plan&#8223;. The bank also offers two other 
</p>
<p>long term benefits: &#8220;Staff Medical Fund&#8221; and &#8220;Leave Encashment&#8221;. A defined benefit plan is 
</p>
<p>post&#8211;employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The bank's net 
</p>
<p>obligation in respect of defined benefits plans is calculated separately for each plan by 
</p>
<p>estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their 
</p>
<p>service in current and prior period; and the benefit is discounted to determine its present 
</p>
<p>value. The bank determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit 
</p>
<p>liability (asset) for the period by applying discount rate used to measure the defined benefit 
</p>
<p>obligation at the beginning of the period to the net defined liability (asset). The obligation 
</p>
<p>under &#8222;Gratuity or Pension Plan&#8223; and &#8222;Staff Security Plan&#8223; is calculated by a qualified actuary 
</p>
<p>every year using projected unit credit method. The discount rate used is the yield at the 
</p>
<p>reporting date on high quality Government Bond having maturity dates approximating the 
</p>
<p>terms of the obligations and are denominated in the Nepalese rupee in which the benefits 
</p>
<p>are expected to be paid.  
</p>
<p>The &#8222;Gratuity and Pension Plan&#8223; and &#8222;Staff Security Plan&#8223; are funded plan wherein the bank 
</p>
<p>makes earmarked investment out of fund created for these plans. &#8222;Leave encashment&#8223; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Staff Medical Fund&#8221; are not a funded plan.  
</p>
<p>There were no plan amendments and curtailments during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p>The details of the net liabilities based on actuarial valuation of obligation for the defined 
</p>
<p>benefit plans, viz., the Gratuity and Pension plan, and the Staff Security Fund are as follows:

</b></p>
<p>The Bank currently offers accumulated leave as other long term benefits plan. The bank's 
</p>
<p>net obligation in respect of other long term benefits plans is calculated separately for each 
</p>
<p>plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for 
</p>
<p>their service in current and prior period; and the benefit is discounted to determine its 
</p>
<p>present value. The bank determines the net interest expense (income) on the net other 
</p>
<p>long term benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying discount rate used to measure 
</p>
<p>the other long term benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the net other long 
</p>
<p>term benefit liability (asset). The obligation under &#8222;Accumulated Leave&#8223; is calculated by a 
</p>
<p>qualified actuary every year using projected unit credit method. The discount rate used is 
</p>
<p>the yield at the reporting date on high quality Government Bond having maturity dates 
</p>
<p>approximating the terms of the obligations and are denominated in the Nepalese rupee in 
</p>
<p>which the benefits are expected to be paid.  
</p>
<p>&#8222;Leave encashment&#8223; is not a funded plan. Same assumptions are taken for measurement of 
</p>
<p>the leave liabilities as adopted for defined benefit liabilities.  
</p>
<p>There were no plan amendments and curtailments during the reporting period. Actuarial 
</p>
<p>gains/losses in other long term benefit plan are charged to statement of income.
