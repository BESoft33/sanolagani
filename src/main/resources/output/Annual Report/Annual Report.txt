Respected Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I take this 
opportunity to express my sincere gratitude and 
warm welcome to all the esteemed shareholders, 
representatives from regulatory bodies, auditor, 
legal advisors, distinguished invitees, journalists, 
ladies and gentlemen to the 27th Annual General 
Meeting of NMB Bank Limited.
Established as Nepal Merchant Banking & 
Finance in the year 1996, the Bank upgraded 
to an “A” class commercial Bank on 2008 and 
has been providing various banking services to 
its customers throughout the country. Despite 
many ups and downs in the market, the Bank 
has been an integral part of Nepalese financial 
sector consistently delivering to its shareholders’ 
expectations for past 27 years. I am honored to be 
present amongst the shareholders whose faith 
and support has enabled the Bank move towards 
continuous progress throughout its journey. I take 
this opportunity to assure everyone that through 
this  cooperation and support of our shareholders 
and well-wishers, the Bank will continue its 
journey towards steady and sustainable progress 
in the future as well.
The Bank has highly prioritized the balanced 
growth in credit and deposit, expansion of 
credit investment in small and medium 
enterprises for economic development of local 
communities thereby supporting country's vision 
of "Prosperous Nepal" along with formulation 
of programs and policies that emphasizes 
the protection of environment in its credit 
investments. The Bank in line with its strategy of 
adopting sustainable banking practices has been 
increasing investment in businessess that seeks 
to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions thus 
reducing the environmental and social risks. The 
debts obtained from various foreign banks and 
financial institutions and the support from lender 
groups in supporting sustainable development 
are testament to the Bank's sustainable initiative. 
In order to meet the demand of investable fund, 
the Bank has given continuity to raise funds 
through issuance of domestic currency bonds, 
and obtaining foreign currency loans as per 
the requirements remaining in line with the 
prevailing directive issued by Nepal Rastra Bank.
 
NMB Bank is committed to provide easy and 
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
simple banking solutions to the customers all 
over the country by expanding its digital services 
by implementing cutting-edge technologies 
while ensuring digital security and privacy of 
its customers' data. In order to deliver better 
customer experience, the Bank has established 
a separate Service Excellence unit. We shall 
continue to expand our social activities through 
various programs and support in order to 
contribute to the society and environment as part 
of our Corporate Social Responsibility. The Bank 
is committed to create a positive impact through 
successful implementation of its plans and 
strategies that will eventually support in building 
a strong and reliable bank.
The Directors of the Bank have placed a high 
importance to the Corporate Governance as it 
also serves as the basis for sound and effective 
financial system. The Board of Directors has been 
continuously supporting at the policy level by 
creating an open and independent environment 
to the executive management of the Bank for 
day to day business and decisions, thus further 
institutionalizing the corporate governance 
practices within the Bank.
The widened gap between the inflow of foreign 
currency created through exports of goods and 
services, remittance inflows, foreign investment/
foreign aid mobilization, and the outflow of 
foreign currency through import of goods and 
services witnessed in the fiscal year 2021/22 has 
created a stress in liquidity that could possibly 
affect the business expansion of banking sector 
during the current year as well. Although there 
has been some increase in the bad loans during 
the year under review, the Bank’s management 
is capable of containing it in a respectable level.
Despite the mounting challenges to the 
economy, the Bank has managed to scale up 
its business and achieve good financial results. 
During the review year, the Bank’s deposits 
increased to NPR 186.40 Billion, while loans and 
advances grew to NPR 182.09 Billion i.e. a growth 
of 11.98% in deposits and 15.21% in loans and 
advances as compared to previous fiscal year. As 
guided by Nepal Rastra Bank through its Unified 
Directive to sanction loan in focused sectors, the 
Bank has maintained loan exposure proportions 
as: Energy-8.28%, Agriculture-12.43%, 
Tourism-3.06%, and Medium, Small and Micro 
Enterprises: 11.06%. In the review year, the Bank’s 
net profit as compared to last year increased by 
21.39% to NPR 3.29 Billion.
The agenda to distribute 8.25% cash dividend 
amounting NPR 1,515,253,241.64 (including tax 
provision) on existing paid-up capital of NPR 
18,366,705,959.24 to the eligible shareholders 
from distributable profit of the fiscal year 2021/22 
is placed for approval in the Annual General 
Meeting despite the challenges in the banking 
sector.
NMB Bank is committed to take its banking 
services to all walks of life for which it has been 
diversifying its business. The Bank has expanded 
its investment in industrial and agricultural 
sectors that contribute towards employment 
generation in the country to remain in line with 
the strategy of increasing credit investment in the 
productive sector. The Bank has been offering 
Women Entrepreneurship Loan with an objective 
of empowering women interested to operate 
own business and be self-reliant. Likewise, 
the Bank has also been providing various loan 
facilities targeted to youths returning from foreign 
employment as part of government’s self-
employment initiative and absorbing their skills 
for economic development of the country. 
Finally, I would like to offer my gracious 
appreciation to the respected shareholders, 
regulatory bodies, media, and customers who 
always show deep interest in our activities and 
provide generous feedback for improvement, 
prosperity, and progress. Likewise, my heartfelt 
gratitude to the banks and financial institutions, 
supervising authorities, other associations,

invaluable support and confidence.
Thank you.

businesses with other foreign establishments.
2. Impact of Domestic and World Economic Outlook On Bank’s Performance
The economic activities around the world has been largely affected by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war due to which 
the world economy is likely to contract as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects the world economy to 
grow by 3.6 percent in 2022 as compared to an expansion by 6.1 percent in 2021. There has been a significant hike 
in the prices of petroleum products and food items due to increase in dollar cost.  Global trade volume and capital 
flows have also been largely affected. Thus, it has created additional inflationary pressures and challenges to the 
global economy while it still has been recovering from the economic aftershocks of COVID-19 pandemic. In order 
to curb the rising inflation, Central banks of many countries are gradually removing relief programs and regulatory 
exemptions adopted to support COVID impact sectors, and are also tightening monetary policy direction to address 
growing imbalance in the economy.
The pressure on price and external sector stability as well as the contraction in the supply of loanable fund have 
created a challenge for Nepal in its path to economic recovery from the pandemic including achieving high economic 
growth. Although, the average inflation has remained within the target in FY 2021/22, the inflation in recent times has 
increased due to surge in the price of fuel and food items, rising global inflation including in neighboring countries, the 
disruption in the supply chain, and the depreciation of Nepalese Rupee against the U.S. Dollar. The total merchandise 
imports of the country are estimated to have reached about 40 percent of the gross domestic product in 2021/22 
which is largely contributed by weak domestic production capacity, and rising consumption trend. In addition to the 
merchandise account, the service account deficit has also been increasing. The current account deficit is expected to 
reach about 13 percent of GDP. Thus, there has been a widening gap between the foreign currency inflow through 
exports, remittances, foreign investment/foreign aid, and the foreign currency outflow through the imports of goods 
and services.
(Source: Monetary Policy for 2022/23, NRB)
The widened gap between the inbound foreign currency created through exports of goods and services, remittance 
inflows, foreign investment, and foreign aid mobilization, and the outbound foreign currency through import of goods 
and services has created a stress in liquidity that could possibly affect the business expansion of banking sector 
during the current fiscal year as well.

CEO

The Nepalese banking industry continued 
to grow post Covid albeit at a slower pace. 
The country backed by strong demand for 
local consumption and investment made 
a swift recovery from Covid crisis. However, 
the growth in consumption led to a surge in 
import and trade imbalance in the wake of 
rising dollar cost resulting to a tight liquidity 
situation throughout the fiscal year 2021/22.
The prolonged stress in liquidity causing a 
squeeze in the interest margin of Nepalese 
banks and financial institutions, an increase 
in their loan loss provisions post Covid due to 
increasing non-performing loans, and higher 
operating cost owing to inflationary pressures 
are some of the key attributing factors behind 
overall slowdown in business growth and 
profitability during the review fiscal year.
Despite the challenges coupled with 
deteriorating global economic situation and 
impact of international conflicts in domestic 
economy, the year 2021/22 proved to be yet 
another successful year for NMB. The Bank 
in this unconventional times and difficult 
market situation managed to deliver a good 
result due to a balanced approach to business 
as per its long term sustainable business 
strategy.
Key Snapshots
• Climate change has become one of 
the pressing global issues of recent 
times, which for our country is also 
one of the major business risks, as 
Nepal is ranked amongst tenth most 
vulnerable countries in the world in 
terms of climate risk. Understanding 
the urgency for action to combat climate 
issue, we at NMB are committed to 
direct our financing activities towards 
mitigating such risks thus always 
putting Environment and Social (E&S) 
impact and sustainability at the core of 
our business strategy.
• We have become the first financial 
institution in Nepal to disclose 
greenhouse gas emissions from our 
financed loan portfolio as per our 
commitment to maintain a high degree 
of transparency in climate reporting.
• During fiscal year 2021/22, we have 
made a significant progress in our 
Environmental, Social and Governance 
(ESG) journey to become the first bank to 
fully implement Environmental & Social 
Risk Management (ESRM) by 2025 as 
per International Finance Corporation 
(IFC) performance standards. Currently, 
we are in the second phase of ESRM 
implementation plan and have been 
working together with our large project 
developers/clients as well for building 
their institutional capacity  to setup their 
own ESRM framework.
• Our aim is to become the most 
sustainable bank in Nepal by 2025 to 
which we seek support and partnership 
of all our stakeholders for moving ahead 
in this journey together. We at NMB 
believe that together we can make a 
difference and contribute for prosperous 
Nepal.
• The Bank continued to invest in its 
business even during the Covid period. 
We expanded our footprints by opening 
20 new branches in different places 
around the country to cater banking 
needs of our customers.
• The Bank has successfully closed the 
issuance of second tranche of Energy 
Bond amounting NPR 2.73 Billion taking 
our total Energy Bond portfolio to NPR 
4.23 Billion despite a very tight liquidity 
condition in the market. NMB is the 
first and the only bank in Nepal to issue 
local currency Energy bond in Nepal as 
a part of our commitment to promote 
Renewable Energy (RE) and hydropower 
development for supporting country’s 
vision of becoming self-reliant on 
Energy.
• We see endless possibilities in 
RE sectors in Nepal and are well-
positioned to seize the opportunity to 
meet financing demand of RE projects 
in current geopolitical context amid 
disruption in smooth supply of fossil fuel 
energy and its rising cost.
• NMB has built a robust recovery solution 
platform that has automated and 
strengthened our loan recovery process.
• The Bank will continue to invest in 
strengthening its physical infrastructure, 
technology platforms, digital channels 
and human capital for building efficiency 
and greater customer experience. 
Focus shall be given on maintaining our 
assets quality and a sound corporate 
governance within the organization.
Amidst the market opportunities and 
prevailing challenges, we believe that the 
banking industry has a lot more to deliver 
and grow. Understanding the unavoidable 
changes manifested by a paradigm shift in 
doing business and critically analysing each 
behavioural change, NMB is all poised to set 
the standards and seize every opportunity in 
the market.
I humbly believe that our success is the 
result of all the hard works, patience and 
determination exerted by our staff who 
together truly forms the most dynamic and 
energetic team force. I would like to extend 
my sincere gratitude to FMO and all our 
foreign partners. I also take this opportunity to 
personally extend my heartfelt thanks to our 
Chairman Mr. Pawan Kumar Golyan and all 
board members for their relentless guidance 
in making NMB one of the most preferred 
Banks of Nepal. Finally, my sincere thanks 
to the esteemed shareholders, Nepal Rastra 
Bank, Ministry of Finance, Securities Board 
of Nepal, Employees Provident Fund, partner 
organizations, subsidiary companies, all other 
regulatory bodies, executive management 
team of the Bank, and most importantly the 
customers of  NMB Bank for their invaluable 
suggestions to our continuous improvement 
and business growth. Going forward, we 
aspire to grow collectively for many years 
with your constant trust and solidarity,
Thank you

strong risk management system.  
 
Risk Measurement 
The Bank has given due focus and priority to quantitatively 
measure various risk issues and enforce mitigation measures, 
control and monitoring for which we have implemented 
new tools and models such as Risk Register/Credit 
Grading, etc. 
 
Risk Management as Shared Responsibility
Bank's  risk management philosophy is driven by the "Three 
Lines of Defence" principle ensuring that risk management 
responsibility is also shared between various units and teams 
engaged in bank's business activities, as such different functions 
takes accountability on their portfolios. The risk governance 
framework defines the “Three Lines of Defence” structure as : 
- Main Business Function 
- Risk Management Department/Control units, and  
- Internal Audit 
The responsibilities of each line have been well defined and 
communicated across the various levels. 
 
Risk Management Structure
Bank has appropriate risk management structure with clear 
demarcation of reporting line on its organogram. It has been 
essential for clear and definitive establishment of roles & 
responsibilities and accountability of various functions within 
the Bank towards risk management. Board has ensured a 
fundamental role in envisioning the risk governance structure

Additionally, the  Bank as an active member of the GABV strives 
for delivering sustainable economic, social and environmental 
development with a focus on helping individuals fulfil their 
needs and build stronger communities.  
Credit Risk Management in NMB Bank
Credit Risk refers to the potential loss due to failure of 
counterparty to meet its obligations in accordance with 
the terms specified in the credit agreements. Credit Policy, 
Credit Process Manual, Product Papers and various other 
credit related documents are in place and implemented that 
provides a solid foundation for  strong credit risk management 
environment. The policy documents defines the clear roles and 
responsibilities of various functions and risk takers in credit 
system and thus strives to build a uniform and strong credit 
risk management culture in the Bank. The Bank’s Credit Policy 
elaborates credit standards and guideline for effective risk 
management.
Further the Bank has independent credit risk management 
department led by Chief Risk Officer for ensuring effective 
Credit Risk Management system as well as to keep close 
track of risk assets portfolio movements, identification of credit 
risks at account level and portfolio level, and mitigations of any 
identified credit issues. A thorough analysis of the borrower 
and the industry in which the borrower operates is ensured 
prior extending credit facilities. The Bank also has an internal 
credit risk rating procedure in place to categorize customers 
in different risk profiles and formulate appropriate account 
strategies. Bank predominantly focuses on loan purpose to 
establish prudent financing requirements of the client and the 
client’s capacity to repay the debt obligation on time.  
 
Credit Risk Management Committee (CRMC) and Risk 
Management Committee (RMC) play a pivotal role in the credit 
risk management of the Bank. The existing/probable credit 
risk issues are reviewed, necessary changes required in the 
credit system to mitigate such risk are identified and required 
decisions are made as appropriate.  
 
The Bank has a product wise and industry/sector wise portfolio 
and NPL thresholds to monitor the quality of loan portfolio and 
manage the concentration risk. These thresholds are reviewed 
on periodical basis in CRMC and RMC in quarterly interval for 
required actions/strategic decisions.  
  
Market Risk and Operation Risk Management 
in NMB Bank
Market and Operation Risk management in Nepalese banks 
has been  a  newer challenge. In the times of volatility and 
fluctuations in the market, NMB Bank needs to prove its 
determination by withstanding the market variations and 
achieve sustainability in terms of growth as well as to have a 
stable share value. NMB has passed through a monumental 
change after the multiple mergers which includes five 
development  banks and one finance company. NMB has taken 
strategic focus on digitization and technological advancement 
to enhance banks services as well as risk management.   
NMB ensures parity between risk and return, and hence, 
management of risk by incorporating a set of systematic and 
Risk Management system and structure of the Bank is driven by following principles 
     39
professional methods especially those defined by the Basel III 
becomes an essential requirement for us.   
  
In the course of operations, the Bank is invariably faced with 
different types of risks that may have a potentially negative 
effect on the business. NMB Bank’s risk management approach 
includes risk identification, measurement and assessment, and 
minimizing the impact on the financial result and capital of the 
bank. The Bank has in place a strong operation and market 
risk management department led by Chief Risk Officer to 
oversee the operation and market risk areas for identification of 
potential risk, analyse, monitor and mitigations of identified risk. 
Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) manages the overall asset 
and liability position of the Bank. It also ensures that the asset 
& liability position, investment and liquidity are maintained at a 
desired level in compliance to NRB Directives. Risk monitoring 
is done periodically conducting stress testing, GAP analysis and 
preparing various reports. 
Operational Risk
Operational risk is the risk of negative effects on the financial 
result and capital of the bank caused by omissions in the work 
of employees, inadequate internal control procedures and 
processes, inadequate management of information and other 
systems, and unforeseeable external events. The  Bank has an 
independent department to look after operational risk wherein 
Operational Risk Management Committee meets on monthly 
basis to discuss and plan the way forward to mitigate potential 
operational risk identified. The Bank has developed and 
adhered to Minimum Control Standards and Incident Reporting 
Guidelines along with Whistle Blowing Policy to identify 
potential operational risks. Operational Risk Department 
independently assess each incident/event/cause to measure 
the risk grade which is ultimately discussed/ analysed further 
in Operational Risk Management Committee to enforce 
appropriate controls in place. Where required, the incident/
event/cause along with the risk assessment, probability and 
impact is escalated further to Risk Management Committee 
or the Board of the Bank. Additionally, Operational Risk Unit 
conducts branch/ department visits to monitor/ review the 
branches and departments and also to train/ create awareness 
on operational risk.  
Market Risk
Market risk includes interest rate and foreign exchange risk. 
Interest rate risk is the risk of negative effects on the financial 
result and capital of the bank as a result of changes in interest 
rates. The Bank’s products are mostly based on floating interest 
rate. Only fixed deposits are with fixed interest rate. In Nepalese 
local market, short term movement in interest rate is negligible. 
Pricing Committee monitors the interest rate movement on 
regular basis.  
Foreign exchange risk is the risk of negative effects on the 
financial result and capital of the bank caused by changes 
in exchange rates. The foreign exchange risk of the Bank 
is minimal as all the transactions are carried out on behalf 
of the customers against underlying remittances and trade 
transactions. The Bank has been considering various hedging 
tools to mitigate the foreign exchange related risks.
  
Liquidity Risk  
Liquidity risk is the potential event where the Bank either does 
not have sufficient liquid financial resources available to meet all 
its obligations as they fall due, or can only access these financial 
resources at excessive cost. The Liquidity Risk Framework 
governs liquidity risk management and is managed by ALCO. 
In accordance with that policy, the Bank maintains a liquid 
portfolio of marketable securities as a liquidity buffer.   
  
Other Risk  
Management of other risk such as Reputational, Legal & 
Compliance, Environmental and Social Risk Management 
and Human Resource (HR) etc. is equally pertinent as the 
Bank grows. The Bank has separate dedicated department to 
oversee E&S Risk Management Legal & Compliance issues 
respectively. HR Department and Board level HR Committee is 
responsible for all HR functions and related risk management. 
 
Internal Control  
The Board and the management is committed in managing 
risks and in controlling its business and financial activities in 
a manner that enables it to maximize profitable business 
opportunities, avoid or minimize risks which can cause potential 
loss or reputational damage to the Bank, ensure compliance 
with applicable laws and regulations and enhance resilience to 
external events. To achieve this, the Bank has established set 
of policies and procedures for risk identification, risk evaluation, 
risk mitigation and control/monitoring.  
The effectiveness of the Bank's internal control system 
is reviewed regularly by the Board, Risk Management 
Committee, Bank's Management and Internal Audit. The 
Internal Audit monitors compliance with policies/standards 
and the effectiveness of internal control structures across 
the organization through its periodic internal audit of various 
departments and business units. The Internal Audit function is 
focused on the areas of highest risk as determined by a risk-
based assessment methodology. Internal Audit reports are 
periodically forwarded to the Audit Committee. The findings of 
all audits are reported to the Chief Executive Officer, department 
heads and branch managers for initiating immediate corrective 
measures.

4.12 Investment properties
Investment properties are land or building or both other than those classified as property and equipment under NAS 
16 – “Property, Plant and Equipment”; and assets classified as non-current assets held for sale under NFRS 5 – “Non-
Current Assets Held for Sale & Discontinued Operations”. The Group has recognized as investment property all land 
or land and building acquired as non banking assets.    
Non banking assets (only land and building) are initially recognized at fair value, since it is not intended for owner-
occupied use; depreciation charge is not raised.
As per NAS 40 ‘Investment Property’ (land and building acquired as non banking assets) are measured at fair value.

instrument prices etc. Derivatives are categorised as trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments. All 
derivatives are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value, with all trading gains or losses recognised

4.23.1: Defined benefit obligations    
The defined-benefit obligation is calculated annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit method. The 
Bank operates a defined contribution plan as provident fund contribution of its employees and defined benefit plan for 
the Gratuity payment requirement under its staff rules. For defined contribution plan, the Bank pays contributions to 
an independently administered retirement fund on a mandatory basis, and such amounts are charged to operating 
expenses. The Bank has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. For funded defined 
benefit plans, the liability recognised in the financial statement is the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
less the fair value of plan assets. Such obligations are estimated on the basis of the actuarial assumptions.
The amounts recognised in the statement of financial position are as follows:

Significant Accounting Policies to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Financial Year 16 July 2021 to 16 July 2022 (1 Shrawan 2078 to 32 Asar 2079)
1. General Information
1.1 Reporting Entity: NMB Bank Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Bank”) is a limited liability company domiciled 
in Nepal. The registered office of the Bank is G.P.O. Box 11543, Babar Mahal, Kathmandu, Nepal.  The Bank has a 
primary listing in the Nepal Stock Exchange Limited, the only Stock Exchange in Nepal.  
The Bank carries out commercial banking activities in Nepal licensed under the Bank and Financial Institutions Act, 
2006 as Class A financial institution in May 2008 and has been operating in the Nepalese Financial market for over 
twenty six years.
1.2 Subsidiary:
a. NMB Capital Ltd. (NMBCL) is a 100% subsidiary company of the Bank and was incorporated on September 17, 2010 
as a public limited company as per the Companies Act 2063.  It is into Merchant and investment banking licensed by 
Securities Board of Nepal under the Securities Businessperson (Merchant Banker) Regulations, 2008. 
b. NMB Laghubitta Bittiya Sanstha Ltd. (NMBMF) is incorporated as a public limited company under Companies Act, 
2063 and licensed by Nepal Rastra Bank as “D” Class financial institution having Nation Wide working area to operate 
its microfinance program under Bank and Financial Institution Act 2006. As at the Balance Sheet date, the bank holds 
51% controlling interest in the NMBMF.
The financial year of both of the subsidiaries is same as that of the Bank ending on July 16, 2022.
1.3 “The Group” represents The Bank and the subsidiaries. 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements of the Bank are set out below. 
Unless otherwise stated, these policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented herein.
2.1 Basis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the Nepal Financial Reporting Standard 
(NFRS) issued by the Nepal Accounting Standards Board (NASB) except otherwise stated in the format issued by 
Nepal Rastra Bank in Directive No. 4 of NRB Directives, 2078 complying with the requirements of Companies Act 
2063 and also provide appropriate disclosures required under regulations of the Securities Exchange Board of Nepal 
(SEBON). The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accrual basis.
The cash flow statement has been prepared using the direct method whereby operating profit is adjusted for effects 
of non-cash transactions such as depreciation and loan losses. The cash flows are classified by operating, investing 
and financing activities. 
The Group has opted for some certain carve outs which are briefly described in Notes to Accounts. As a consequence 
of carve out adjustments, net profit would have been impacted.
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statement, the financial statements of the Bank and the Subsidiary are 
combined line by line by adding together Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Income and Expenses. The consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with Nepal Financial Reporting Standards 10 “Consolidated Financial 
Statements”. 
Para 8 of NFRS 10 outlines three conditions to be fulfilled in order to establish control:
     (a) Power over the investee;
     123
(b) Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
(c) The ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns
Non-Controlling Interest (NCI) refers to ownership of a company, which does not give the shareholder the control of 
the company.
2.2 Going Concern 
The Board of Directors have made an assessment of Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern and are satisfied 
that it has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the board is not aware of any 
material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern and they do 
not intend either to liquidate or to cease operations of it. Hence, the Financial Statements are continued to be prepared 
on the going concern basis.
2.3 Responsibility for Financial Statements 
As stated in paragraph 6 of NAS 01 “Presentation of Financial Statements” read along with Section 108(2) of the 
Company Act, 2006 the Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Bank. The 
Board of Directors acknowledges this responsibility. The Financial statements include the following components:
(a) Consolidated Statement of Financial Position(SOFP) stating the financial position of the Bank and the Group as at 
the end of reporting period;
(b) Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (SOPL) and Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income 
(SOCI) stating the financial performance of the Bank and the Group for the reported period ended.
(c)  Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow Statement (SOCF) stating the ability of Bank and the Group to generate 
Cash and Cash Equivalent.
(d)  Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity (SOCE) stating all the changes in Equity of the Bank and the Group 
during the reporting period.
(e)  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements comprising summary of Principal Accounting Policies and 
explanatory notes that are of significant importance to the users of Financial Statements.
2.4 Reporting Period and approval of financial statement
The Bank follows the Nepalese financial year based on the Nepalese calendar. The corresponding dates for the 
English calendar are as follows:
Relevant Financial Statement Nepalese Calendar Date/Period English Calendar Date/Period
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position 32 Ashad 2079 16 July 2022
Consolidated Statement of Profit/Loss 1 Shrawan 2078 to 32 Ashad,2079 16 July 2021 to 16 July 2022
Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive 
Income
1 Shrawan 2078 to 32 Ashad,2079 16 July 2021 to 16 July 2022
Consolidated Statement of Cash flow 1 Shrawan 2078 to 32 Ashad,2079 16 July 2021 to 16 July 2022
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity 1 Shrawan 2078 to 32 Ashad,2079 16 July 2021 to 16 July 2022
The consolidated financial statements of the group for the year ended 16 July 2022 have been authorized by the 
Board of directors and have recommended for its approval by the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
2.5 Foreign Exchange Transactions 
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as on the balance sheet date have been converted into local 
currency at mid-point exchange rates published by Nepal Rastra Bank after adjustment for effective trading rate.  
Net difference arising from the conversion of foreign currency assets and liabilities is accounted for as revaluation 
gain/loss under Exchange Gain in Schedule 4.34.  25% of such revaluation gain is transferred to Exchange Fluctuation 
Reserve through Statement of Change in Equity as per NRB Directives.  
Income realised from the difference between buying and selling rates of Foreign Exchange is accounted for as 
trading gains and shown as “Gain/loss foreign exchange transaction" under "Net Trading Income" in Schedule 4.33
NMB Bank
Annual Report 2021-2022124
2.6 Functional and presentation currency
The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Nepalese Rupees (NPR), the functional currency of Group 
entities. The Consolidated financial statements are prepared in the formats implemented by Nepal Rastra Bank and 
the assets and liabilities are presented in the order of liquidity in the statement of financial position. The Income 
and expenses are classified ‘by nature’ in the presentation of statement of profit or loss. All figures in the accounts 
have been rounded and consequently the sum of individual figures may deviate from the presented sum figure. 
Furthermore, all percentages are subject to possible rounding differences.
2.7 Significant accounting judgements and estimates
As part of the process of preparing the financial statements in conformity with NFRS, the Bank’s management is 
required to make certain judgements, estimates and assumptions that may affect the Bank’s profits, its financial 
position and other information presented in the Annual Report. These estimates are based on available information 
and the judgements made by the Bank’s management. Actual outcomes may deviate from the assessments made, 
and such deviations may at times be significant.
The Bank uses various valuation models and techniques to estimate the fair values of assets and liabilities. There are 
significant uncertainties related to these estimates and these estimates are highly dependent on market data, such as 
the level of interest rates, currency rates and other factors. The uncertainties related to these estimates are reflected 
mainly in the statement of financial position. The bank undertakes continuous development in order to improve 
the basis for fair value estimates, with regard to both modelling and market data. Changes in estimates resulting 
from refinements in assumptions and methodologies are reflected in the period in which the enhancements are first 
applied. Judgements and estimates are also associated with impairment testing of loans and claims.
2.8 Change in Accounting Policies
The bank has changed its accounting policies when required, to ensure compliance with NFRS. The effect of change 
in accounting policies at the date of transition has been given to the retained earnings (and reserves, if applicable)
2.9 Materiality and Aggregation
In compliance with Nepal Accounting Standard - NAS 01 (Presentation of Financial Statements), each material class 
of similar items is presented separately in the Financial Statements. Items of dissimilar nature or functions too are 
presented separately unless they are immaterial. Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are offset and the net 
amount reported in the Statement of Financial Position only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liability 
simultaneously. Income and expenses are not offset in the Statement of Profit or Loss unless required or permitted 
by an Accounting Standard.
2.10 NFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’-Impairment
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ was issued by the IASB in July 2014 and effective internationally for the financials 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018 while NFRS 9 which is in line with IFRS 9 is applicable from FY 2078.79.   The 
bank has applied Carve out Issued by ICAN on 2079/04/02 for impairment calculation and recognition. 
Expected Credit Loss Model (ECL) of Impairment
The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model is a forward-looking model. The ECL estimates are unbiased, probability 
weighted, and include supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic 
conditions. 
Under the general approach, NFRS 9 recognizes three-stage approach to measure expected credit losses and 
recognized interest income.
Stage 1: 12-month ECL – No significantly increased credit risk Financial instruments that have not had a significant 
increase in credit risk since initial recognition require, at initial recognition a provision for ECL associated with the 
probability of default events occurring within the next 12 months (12-month ECL). For those financial assets with a 
remaining maturity of less than 12 months, a Probability of Default (PD) is used that corresponds to the remaining 
maturity. Interest will be calculated on the gross carrying amount of the financial asset before adjusting for ECL.
     125
Stage 2: Lifetime ECL – Significantly increased credit risk in the event of a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition, a provision is required for the lifetime ECL representing losses over the life of the financial instrument 
(lifetime ECL).  Interest income will continue to be recognized on a gross basis.
Stage 3: Lifetime ECL – Defaulted Financial instruments that move into Stage 3 once credit impaired and purchases of 
credit impaired assets will require a lifetime provision. Interest income will be calculated based on the gross carrying 
amount of the financial asset less ECL.
The management is still assessing the potential impact on its financial statements, if Expected Credit Loss (ECL) 
model is introduced.

The bank has adopted carve out issued by ICAN dated 2079/04/02 and has created impairment higher of provision 
as per NRB and impairment calculated as described in point no 2.18
2.11 NFRS-15: Revenue from contract with customers
NFRS 15 is a new standard for revenue recognition which overhauls the existing revenue recognition standards. The 
standard requires the following five step model framework to be followed for revenue recognition:
•    Identification of the contracts with the customer
•   Identification of the performance obligations in the contract
•   Determination of the transaction price
•   Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (as identified in step ii)
•   Recognition of revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 
NFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers superseded existing NAS 18 Revenue and NAS 11 Construction 
Contract from FY 2078/79.
2.12 Basis for classification and measurement 
Financial assets are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are classified and subsequently measured at fair 
value through profit or loss (FVTPL), fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or amortized cost based 
on our business model for managing the financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
instrument. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for:
• As per NFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”, Investment Securities (investment in equity shares and mutual funds) are 
measured at fair value.
• Derivative Financial Instruments are measured at fair value (FVTPL).
• Non-derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value
• Inventories are measured at cost or net realizable value whichever is lower.
• As per NAS 40 ‘Investment Property’ (land and building acquired as non banking assets) are measured at fair 
value.
• As per NAS 19 “Employee Benefits”, Liabilities for employee defined benefit obligations and liabilities for long 
service leave are measured at fair value.
Financial assets at amortised cost
An investment is classified at “amortised cost” only if it is not designated as a FVTPL and both of the following criteria 
are met: the objective of the Bank’s business model is to hold the assets in order to collect the contractual cash 
flows, and the contractual terms of the financial assets must give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are only 
NMB Bank
Annual Report 2021-2022126
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial assets at fair value
If either of the two criteria above is not met, the asset cannot be classified in the amortised cost category and must 
be classified at fair value.
Determination of fair value
The fair value of financial instruments, including derivative instruments that are traded in a liquid market, is the bid or 
offered closing price on the balance sheet date. Where the fair values cannot be derived from active markets, they are 
determined using a variety of valuation techniques which include the use of mathematical models. The input to these 
models is taken from observable market data where possible. Fair values are measured using different valuation 
models and techniques. This process involves determining future expected cash flows, which can then be discounted 
to the balance sheet date. The estimation of future cash flows for these instruments is subject to assumptions on 
market data, the fair value estimate may therefore be subject to variations and may not be realisable in the market. 
Under different market assumptions, the values could also differ significantly.
The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, which reflects the significance of the inputs 
used in making the measurements:
Level 1: Quoted market prices (unadjusted) in an active market for identical instruments.
Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived 
from prices). This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar 
instruments, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active or 
other valuation techniques where all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.
Level 3: Valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs. This category includes all instruments where 
the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and where the unobservable inputs have a 
significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted 
prices for similar instruments where significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect 
differences between the instruments.
2.13 Financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets refer to assets that arise from contractual agreements on future cash flows or from owning equity 
instruments of another entity. Since financial assets derive their value from a contractual claim, these are non physical 
in form and are usually regarded as being more liquid than other tangible assets.
Financial liabilities are obligations that arise from contractual agreements and that require settlement by way of 
delivering cash or another financial asset. Settlement could also require exchanging other financial assets or financial 
liabilities under potentially unfavourable conditions. Settlement may also be made by issuing own equity instruments.
2.14 Recognition and de-recognition of financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised in the statement of financial position on a settlement date basis, except for 
derivative instruments, which are recognized on a trade date basis.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire.
A financial liability is derecognised from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the 
contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
2.15 Business Combination
The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the 
Group as per NFRS 3. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the 
identifiable net assets acquired. The Bank had combined the business as per Merger and Acquisition Bylaws 2073 
issued by central bank during the previous years. However, after the issuance of the Explanatory Note Accounting for 
Business Combination dated 2079.04.15, the Carve out no. 3 and 4 on NFRS 3: Business Combination issued by ICAN 
on 2077.07.25 stands withdrawn and accordingly, the goodwill has been recognized as per the said guidelines.
     127
2.16 Offsetting
A financial asset and a financial liability are offset and the net amount recognised only where there is a legal right to 
do so and the intention is to settle on a net basis.
2.17 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise monetary assets and placements with original maturities of three months (91 
Days) or less, calculated from the date the acquisition and placements were made.
                    
Cash and cash equivalents are classified as financial asset and are measured at amortized cost in SoFP.
Restricted deposits are not included in cash and cash equivalents. These are measured at amortized cost and 
presented as a line item on the face of consolidated Statement of Financial Position (SoFP).
2.18 Impairment
Impairment of financial assets
The Bank assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 
financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are 
incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events occurring after the 
initial recognition of the asset (a loss event), and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future 
cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
The Bank considers the following factors in assessing objective evidence of impairment: 
• a significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor;
• a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments;
• it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization;
• Where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a 
group of financial assets since the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease cannot yet be identified 
with the individual financial assets in the group, including adverse changes in repayment patterns or economic 
conditions that correlate with defaults.
Assets carried at amortised cost
Financial assets carried at amortised cost (such as amounts due from Banks, loans and advances to customers as 
well as held–to–maturity investments are impaired, and impairment losses are recognized, only if there is objective 
evidence as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset. The amount of the 
loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the deemed recoverable value of loan.
The recoverable value of loan is estimated on the basis of realizable value of collateral (value of collateral is considered 
after hair cut prescribed by NRB) and the conduct of the borrower/past experience of the bank. Assets that are 
individually assessed and for which no impairment exists are grouped with financial assets with similar credit risk 
statistics and collectively assessed for impairment. The credit risk statistics for each group of the loan and advances 
are determined by management prudently being based on the past experience.
Subsequent reversal of impairment loss, due to factors such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating, is 
recognized in the statement of profit or loss. The reversal shall not result in a carrying amount of the financial asset 
that exceeds what the amortized cost would have been had the impairment not been recognized at the date the 
impairment is reversed. Financial assets (and the related impairment allowance accounts) are written off either 
partially or in full, when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Where financial assets are secured, this is generally 
after receipt of any proceeds from the realization of security. If a future write–off is later recovered, the recovery is 
credited to the ’Income Statement’.
At each reporting date the Bank assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may have been impaired. If 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount is determined. For individual impairment, bank considers Top 50 loan 
clients and loans above delinquency of 90 days.
NMB Bank
Annual Report 2021-2022128
For the purpose of collective assessment of impairment bank has categorized assets in to four broad products as 
follows:
1. OD Loan
2. Retail EMI
3. Working Capital
4. Term Loan
2.19 Derivative assets and derivative liabilities
Derivative assets and derivative liabilities (derivatives) create rights and obligations that have the effect of transferring 
between the parties to the instrument one or more of the financial risks inherent in an underlying primary financial 
instrument. However, they generally do not result in a transfer of the underlying primary financial instrument on 
inception of the contract, nor does such a transfer necessarily take place on maturity of the contract. 
Derivative financial instruments meet the definition of a financial instrument and are accounted for as derivative 
financial asset or derivative financial liability measured at FVTPL and corresponding fair value changes are recognized 
in profit or loss.
2.20 Grant
Grant is recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity recognises as expenses 
the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. Income approach is followed in recording grant 
income. Grants related to the assets including non-monetary grants at fair value is presented in the statement of 
financial position by setting up Deferred Grant Income. Grants related to income are presented as part of profit or loss 
under other income.
2.21 Deposits from customers and BFIs and Debt Securities
These are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. 
2.22 Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognized only when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow 
to the entity. In some cases, this may not be probable until the consideration is received or until an uncertainty is 
removed. 
Revenue is derived substantially from banking business and related activities and comprises net interest income and 
non-interest income. Income is recognised on an accrual basis in the period in which it accrues. The Group applies 
NFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers in the accounting of revenue, unless otherwise stated. 
a. Net interest income 
Interest income and expenses are recognised in profit or loss for all interest-bearing instruments on an accrual basis 
using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the expected estimated 
future cash payments and receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or liability. Where financial assets

13. Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per equity share are computed in accordance with NAS 33 Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per 
equity share are computed by dividing net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the year. Bonus shares, also known as scrip dividends, involve the issue of shares without any consideration. 
Since the bonus shares do not change the resources available to the entity to earn a return for the shareholders (as in 
the case of shares issued for cash) the effect of change in number of shares in the EPS calculation is cancelled for the 
year in which bonus issue takes place and as well as in the prior periods presented. The EPS has also been restated 
in Principal Indicators. 
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the computation of earnings per share.

The Group deals in bullion (Gold/Silver) by holding stock on consignment basis on behalf of suppliers as per the 
arrangement. The value of consignment as on balances sheet date is Nil and has been reflected under “Advance

Directives.
25. Capital Construction 
There are no capital constructions (pending capitalization) as at the end of the current fiscal year. 
26.  Loan Impairment
The bank maintains an allowance for credit losses relating to on-balance sheet exposures of loans and advances.
Loans, which are individually significant (the threshold being selected to cover up top 50 files, files under 50% and 100% 
provision and files with special asset management department), are assessed individually for objective indicators of 
impairment. A loan is considered impaired when it is determined that bank will not be able to collect all amounts due 
according to the original contractual terms. Credit exposures of individually significant loans are evaluated based on 
factors including the borrower’s overall financial condition, resources and payment record, and where applicable, the 
realizable value of any collateral. If there is evidence of impairment leading to an impairment loss, then the amount 
of the loss is determined as the difference between the carrying value of the loan, including accrued interest, and the 
estimated recoverable amount. The estimated recoverable amount is measured as the present value of expected 
future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate, including cash flows that may result from the 
realization of collateral less costs to sell.
Loans which are not individually significant, or which are individually assessed and not determined to be impaired, are 
collectively assessed for impairment. For the purposes of a collective evaluation of impairment, loans are grouped 
based on similar credit risk characteristics, taking into account loan type, past due status and other relevant factors 
viz. OD Loan, Working Capital Loan, Term Loan and Retail EMI.  The collective impairment allowance is determined by 
reviewing factors including historical loss experience, which takes into consideration historical probabilities of default, 
loss given default and exposure at default. 
The impairment status as per para Carve Out issued by ICAN is given below:
Particulars Year ended 32 Asar 2079 Year ended 31 Asar 2078
a. Individual Impairment 1,813,822,014 1,103,332,419

27. Carve-outs in NFRS
Upon the recommendation from Accounting Standard Board-Nepal, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal 
(ICAN) has issued following carve-outs for the implementation of NFRS and has prescribed alternative treatments as 
set out  below dated 2079/04/02:
a. Impairment
This is the carve out from the requirement to determine impairment loss on financial assets – loans and advances by 
Particulars Year ended 32 Asar 2079 Year ended 31 Asar 2078
OD Loan 14% 12%
Term Loan 7% 6%
Retail EMI 11% 12%
Working Capital Loan 7% 5%
     143
adopting the ‘Incurred Loss Model’ as specified in carve out of ICAN unless the entity is a bank or a financial institution 
registered as per Bank and Financial Institutions Act 2073. Such entities shall measure impairment loss on loans and 
advances at the higher of:
•  amount derived as per norms prescribed by Nepal Rastra Bank for loan loss provisioning; and
•  amount determined as per para 5 described in Carve Out adopting Incurred Loss Model
This is the mandatory carve out. Hence, the Group has recognized impairment loss on loans and advances at the 
higher of the amount derived as per prudential norms specified in NRB directive and the amount derived from 
incurred loss model as specified in carve out is given below:
Particulars Year ended 32 Asar 2079 Year ended 31 Asar 2078
a. Impairment on Loan as per Para 5 of Carve Out 2,198,512,210 1,484,874,816
b. Loan Loss Provision as per NRB 4,703,121,289 4,739,972,013
Higher of a and b 4,703,121,289  4,739,972,013
b. NFRS 9 : Financial Instruments
Effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the 
expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the 
amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the bank shall estimate the expected 
cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, 
call, and similar options) but shall not consider the expected credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points 
paid or received unless it is immaterial or impracticable to determine reliably between parties to the contract that 
are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The bank has opted the carve out for Effective Interest Rate and 
associated fees.
28. Goodwill on Business Combination
During the fiscal year 2077/78, the bank had acquired erstwhile Kanchan Development Bank Limited (KDBL) and 
commenced joint operations from 23 August 2020 (07 Bhadra 2077). Post-acquisition, KDBL shareholders had 
received 0.85 shares of NMB for each share of KDBL (swap ratio of 85%).  Similarly, during the fiscal year 2076/77, the 
bank had merged with Om Development Bank Limited and commenced joint operations from 27 September 2019 
(11 Ashwin 2076) as NMB Bank Limited. The Bank has issued 19,115,791 units of shares to shareholders of E-ODBL 
as purchase consideration on the basis of swap ratio of 0.76 shares of NMB Bank Ltd. for each share of E-ODBL 
recommended by an independent valuator in accordance with Merger and Acquisition Bylaw 2073 issued by the 
Central Bank. The bank had adopted conventional way of booking swap gain from merger and acquisition as per point 
9(Kha) of NRB Merger and Acquisition Bylaws, 2073 then. However, after the issuance of this Explanatory Note, the 
Carve-out no. 3 and 4 on NFRS 3: Business Combination issued by ICAN on 2077.07.25 stands withdrawn and revised 
treatment is applicable for Goodwill computation.
Para 32 of NFRS 3 states that “The acquirer shall recognize goodwill as of the acquisition date measured as the 
excess of (a) over (b) below:
(a)  The consideration transferred measured in accordance with this NFRS, which generally requires acquisition- 
date fair value 
 (b)  The net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed   
measured in accordance with this NFRS.
As per Explanatory Note on Accounting for Business Combination dated 31 July 2022, Goodwill may be measured 
in a business combination effected through exchange of equity interest of the acquirer by considering the business 
valuation of acquiree computed based on the similar terms as for the purpose of computing swap ratio which is 
agreed by the parties involved and approved by regulator and AGM of the company and hence is reflective of fair 
value. The excess of consideration paid by the acquirer over the business value of the acquiree is only considered as 
goodwill because it represents the expected synergies and other benefits arising from combining the businesses.
The calculation of Goodwill as per explanatory note is given below:

 No. of Shares of Merging Entity at DDA Date 19,115,791 5,313,000
Difference - 531,300
The number of shares considered for Goodwill is given below: 
The bank has recognized NPR. 72,829,139 as Goodwill and apportioned under other  Reserve of equity. 
Since the recoverable amount is higher than carrying amount of the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) (value in use), 
goodwill allocated is not impaired.  
29. Risk Management
Risk Management Structure
NMB Board is the ultimate authority to oversee overall risk management of the Bank by formulating risk management 
strategies, defining risk appetite, and ensuring that the risk management policies, procedures and standards are 
adequate and is effectively implemented in the Bank. Sound risk management system in the Bank is established 
robust risk management structure which includes Board level Risk Management Committee, Audit committee, 
Human Resource committee and Asset Laundering prevention committee; management level Asset & Liability 
Committee, Credit Risk Management Committee, Operational Risk Management Committee, E&S (Environmental & 
Social) Committee, Credit Recovery Committee, Corporate Information Security Committee, Pricing Committee,  and 
Corporate Governance Committee. In this structure, new/revised policies & standards, reports on risk management, 
portfolio analysis, stress testing, investment, liquidity, capital adequacy, industry/market analysis, and critical risk 
issues identified are first reviewed by management level committee and then escalated to Risk Management 
Committee for review and decision. Risk management structure in the bank's Organogram.

Risk Management system and structure of the Bank is driven by following  principles:  
• Independent Role: The bank has Risk Management Function independent from risk taker. All management 
units report to the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) who directly report to the board level Risk Management Committee. 
•  Risk Measurement: The Bank has prioritized to quantitatively measure various risk issues and arranged for 
their mitigation, control and monitoring wherever possible. For quantitatively measuring these risks, the Bank 
has implemented new tools and models such as Risk Register/, Credit Grading, etc.
•  Risk Management as Shared Responsibility: The Bank has independent function for management of various 
risks which has been driven by the shared responsibility of risk management units and various business units 
of the Bank. The risk governance framework has adopted “three lines of defence” structure that includes three 
distinct units comprised of:
           - Main Business Function
           - Risk Management Department/Control units, and 
           - Internal Audit
The responsibilities of each line have been well defined and communicated across the various levels.
•  Risk Management Structure: The Bank has appropriate risk management structure with clear demarcation of 
reporting line on its organogram. It has been essential for establishing roles & responsibilities and accountability
   of various functions within the Bank on risk management. The role of board of Directors in risk management has 
   been more effective upon envisioning the risk governance structure of the Bank.
•  Continuous Improvement: The Bank has always been oriented for strengthening existing risk management
   system. As a part of this, the Bank has recently implemented ISO 27001: 2013 standard. It has been expected to
   significantly improve information security management system as well as support risk management system
   through various aspects.
NMB Bank
Annual Report 2021-2022146
In addition, the Bank as an active member of the Global Alliance for Banking on Values (GABV) strives for delivering 
sustainable economic, social and environmental development with a focus on helping individuals fulfil their needs 
and build stronger communities. 
 
Credit Risk Management in NMB Bank:
Credit Risk refers to the potential loss due to failure of counterparty to meet its obligations in accordance with the 
terms specified in the credit agreements. Credit Policy, Credit Risk Management Framework, Credit Process Manual, 
Product Papers and various other credit related documents in place provides the firm foundation for a strong 
credit risk management environment in the bank by defining clear roles and responsibilities of various functions 
and risk takers in Credit system. The Bank’s Credit Policy elaborates credit standards and guideline for effective risk 
management. The Bank has delegated credit approval limits to various officials to approve and sanction various 
amount of credit request based on their individual expertise and risk judgment capability. The key independent units 
responsible for ensuring effective Credit Risk Management in the bank are Credit Risk Management Department, 
Credit Administration Department, Control Department, Special Assets Management Department, various Business 
Units and Internal Audit.  
A thorough analysis of the borrower and the industry in which the borrower operates is ensured prior extending credit 
facilities. The Bank also has an internal credit risk rating procedure in place to categorize customers in different risk 
profiles and formulate appropriate account strategies. The Bank primarily focuses on ensuring prudent financing 
requirements of the client and the client’s capacity to repay the debt obligation on time. 
Credit Risk Management Committee (CRMC) and Risk Management Committee (RMC) play a pivotal role in the credit 
risk management of the Bank. The existing/probable credit risk issues are reviewed, necessary changes required in 
the credit system to mitigate such risk are identified and required decisions are made as appropriate. 
The Bank has a product wise and industry/sector wise portfolio and NPL thresholds to monitor the quality of loan 
portfolio and manage the concentration risk. These thresholds are reviewed on periodical basis in CRMC and RMC in 
quarterly interval for required actions/strategic decisions.  
Market Risk and Operation Risk Management in NMB Bank:
Market and Operation Risk management in Nepalese Banks has been a newer challenge. In the times of volatility 
and fluctuations in the market, NMB Bank needs to prove its determination by withstanding the market variations and 
achieve sustainability in terms of growth as well as to have a stable share value. Hence, an essential component of 
enhanced risk management framework would be to mitigate all the risks and rewards of the products and services 
offered by the bank.  
 
NMB has passed through a monumental change after the merger with four Development Banks and one Finance 
Company. NMB has taken strategic focus on digitization and technological advancement to enhance banks services 
as well as risk management.  
 
NMB ensures parity between risk and return and hence, management of risk by incorporating a set of systematic and 
professional methods especially those defined by the Basel III becomes an essential requirement for us.  
 
In the course of operations, the bank is invariably faced with different types of risks that may have a potentially 
negative effect on the business. NMB Bank’s risk management approach includes risk identification, measurement 
and assessment, and minimizes impact on the financial result and capital of the bank.
Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) manages the overall asset and liability position of the Bank. It also ensures that 
the asset & liability position, investment and liquidity are maintained at a desired level in compliance to NRB Directives. 
Risk monitoring is done periodically-at least on monthly basis by Treasury, Market Risk and Finance Departments by 
conducting stress testing, GAP analysis and preparing various reports.
Market risk includes interest rate and foreign exchange risk. 
Interest rate risk is the risk of negative effects on the financial result and capital of the bank as a result of changes in 
interest rates.  
     147
The bank’s products are mostly based on floating interest rate. Only fixed deposits are with fixed interest rate. In 
Nepalese local market, short term movement in interest rate is negligible. Pricing Committee monitors the interest 
rate movement on regular basis. 
Foreign exchange risk is the risk of negative effects on the financial result and capital of the bank caused by changes 
in exchange rates. The foreign exchange risk of the bank is minimal as all the transactions are carried out on behalf 
of the customers against underlying remittances and trade transactions.  
 
Operational risk is the risk of negative effects on the financial result and capital of the bank caused by omissions in the 
work of employees, inadequate internal control procedures and processes, inadequate management of information 
and other systems, and unforeseeable external events. 
NMB Bank has independent department to look after operational risk wherein Operational Risk Management 
Committee meets on monthly basis to discuss and plan the way forward to mitigate potential operational risk 
identified.  
Bank has developed and adhered to Minimum Control Standards and Incident Reporting Guidelines along with 
Whistle Blowing Policy to identify potential operational risks. Operational Risk Department independently assess 
each incident/event/cause to measure the risk grade which is ultimately discussed/ analyzed further in Operational 
Risk Management Committee to put appropriate controls in place. If required, the incident/event/cause along with 
the risk assessment, probability and impact is escalated further to Risk Management Committee or the Board of the 
Bank. Apart from that, Operational Risk Unit conducts branch/ department visits to monitor/ review the branches and 
departments and also to train/ create awareness on operational risk. 
 
Liquidity Risk 
Liquidity risk is the potential event where the Bank either does not have sufficient liquid financial resources available 
to meet all its obligations as they fall due, or can only access these financial resources at excessive cost. The Liquidity 
Risk Framework governs liquidity risk management and is managed by ALCO. In accordance with that policy, the 
Bank maintains a liquid portfolio of marketable securities as a liquidity buffer.  
 
E&S Risk: 
Environmental and Social management is one of the top priorities for NMB Bank which underlines its resolution 
towards Responsible Banking as well as complementing its business intent of Sustainable Banking.
The Bank has in place an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) of international standards. NMB 
is the only local bank in the country following IFC Performance standards in its Environmental and Social (E&S) due 
diligence. The bank has effectively integrated E&S risk assessment and management as significant part of its overall 
Business and Risk Assessment processes. The bank has developed a robust online system for E&S management

Other Risk 
Management of other risk such as Reputational, Legal & Compliance, Environmental and Social Risk Management 
and Human Resource (HR) etc. is equally pertinent as the bank grows. The bank has separate department to oversee 
Legal & Compliance issues. HR Department and Board level HR Committee is responsible for all HR functions and 
related risk management. 
Internal Control 
The Board and the management is committed in managing risks and in controlling its business and financial activities 
in a manner which enables it to maximize profitable business opportunities, avoid or minimize risks which can cause 
potential loss or reputational damage to the bank, ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and 
enhance resilience to external events. To achieve this, bank has established set of policies and procedures for risk 
identification, risk evaluation, risk mitigation and control/monitoring. 
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control system is reviewed regularly by the Board, Risk Management 
Committee, Management and Internal Audit.  
The Internal Audit monitors compliance with policies/standards and the effectiveness of internal control structures 
across the Company through its program of business/unit audits. The Internal Audit function is focused on the areas 
of greatest risk as determined by a risk-based assessment methodology. Internal Audit reports are periodically 
forwarded to the Audit Committee. The findings of all audits are reported to the Chief Executive Officer, department 
heads and branch managers for initiating immediate corrective measures 
30. Categories of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Hierarchy
Assets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels 
according to the observability of the significant inputs used to determine the fair values. Changes in the observability 
of significant valuation inputs during the reporting period may result in a transfer of assets and liabilities within 
the fair value hierarchy. The Bank recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy when there is a 
significant change in either its principal market or the level of observability of the inputs to the valuation techniques 
as at the end of the reporting period.
Financial instruments are measured on an ongoing basis either at fair value or at amortized cost. The summary of 
significant accounting policies describes how the classes of financial instruments are measured, and how income and 
expenses, including fair value gains and losses, are recognized.
Fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities.
Valuations are those with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted 
prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued 
using models where all significant inputs are observable.
Portfolios are those where at least one input, which could have a significant effect on the 
instrument’s valuation, is not based on observable market data.

32. Operating Segments
a) General Information:
The bank has identified its segments on the basis of geographical location as per provinces of the country. The bank 
supervises, manages and controls its branch networks through regional demarcations.  All the transactions have 
been done at the arm's length prices between the segments with intra segment revenue and cost being eliminated 
at the Head Office. Interest earnings and foreign exchange gains/losses generated while conducting businesses 
under different segments are reported under the respective segment. Equity and Tax Expense are not allocated to the 
individual segments. For segmentation purpose, all business transactions of offices and business units located in a 
particular province are grouped together.

revenues 
The products and services offered by the Bank can be broadly divided into the following categories:
1. Retail Banking: Retail banking, also known as consumer banking, is the provision of services by a bank to the 
general public, rather than to companies, corporations or other banks. Banking services which are regarded as retail 
include provision of savings and transactional accounts, mortgages, personal loans, debit cards, and credit cards.
2.Corporate, SME & Institutional (except Retail): The corporate and institutional banking segment of banks typically 
serves a diverse range of clients, ranging from small- to mid-sized local businesses with a few millions in revenues 
to large conglomerates with billions in sales and offices across the country. 
3 Treasury Unit – The unit has two divisions – Front and back treasury operations. It operates within the consideration 
of the foreign exchange rules and regulations under the guidance of Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) – central bank of Nepal.

are conducted on an arm’s length basis, with inter-segment revenue and costs being eliminated in “Others”. Support

Committee which meets once each month is a platform to assess/monitor operational risk identified vides various 
units, branches. Effective implementation of process/controls is periodically reviewed by an Operational Risk Unit.

robust controls around the risk areas and monitors execution of control in an ongoing basis.
Audit Committee is formed as per the 'Terms of Reference' prescribed by NRB with 3 members. Coordinator of the 
committee is one of the Non-Executive Directors with Chief Audit Executive as its secretary. The committee reviews 
internal/external/NRB audit reports, recommends stringent control process and escalates the audit observations to 
the Board. The Committee also reviews quarterly unaudited financial reports of the Bank with recommendation to 
the Board. The committee selects and recommends External Auditor to the Board based on financial and technical 
evaluations. Audit Committee is committed towards maintaining robust control system hence monitors closure of 
risk issues raised by Internal/External/NRB auditors.

requirement is formed with 5 members, two board members, Chief Operating Officer, Credit Risk Officer as Secretary 
and Head Legal and Compliance are the members of the committee chaired by Non-Executive Director. The committee

risks and recommends to the Board if required. Stress testing/Capital adequacy is also reviewed at the committee 
with recommendation to the Board. Revised/new NRB directives, Monetary Policy with material impact on the Bank
