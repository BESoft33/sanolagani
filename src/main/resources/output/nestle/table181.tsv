ANNEXURE - 5 TO THE BOARD’S REPORT Information as required under Section 134(3)(m) of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 8 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 forming part of the Board’s Report for the year ended 31st December 2022: ACONSERVATION OF ENERGY (a)Steps taken or impact on conservation of energy: Your Company continued to accelerate its sustainability efforts in 2022, even though it was challenging year. Keeping people safe and ensuring consumers have access to the Company’s foods and beverages has remained central to your Company’s activities across the country. As part of long-term sustainability, your Company ensures that the products, packaging and operations are safe for employees, consumers and the environment. Your Company ensures this with a focus on technologies, processes and improvements that matter for the environment. At Nestlé, sustainability inspires and guides everything your Company does. Moreover, your Company gives highest priority to ensure environmental friendly practices at all factories and offices. These include reduction in power consumption, optimal water consumption, eliminating excess use of paper and using eco-friendly products. As in the past, your Company continued to stress upon measures for the conservation and optimal utilisation of energy in all the areas of operations, including those for energy generation and effective usage of sources/ equipment used for generation. Within your Company, there are continuous efforts towards improving operational efficiencies, minimizing consumption of natural resources and reducing water, energy & CO2 emissions while maximizing production volumes. During the year, nine energy reduction projects were undertaken by factories of your Company which will result in substantial annualized savings of approximately 23,299 Gigajoules (saving of 0.59% of total annual energy consumption) and should be realized in next two to three years. Some of the projects undertaken at different factory locations include flash steam heat recovery from condensate; automation of burners in boiler operations; and electricity optimization in reverse osmosis, vacuum pump, compressed air operations. During the year, your Company continued to manage water resources by improving efficiencies and helping to restore natural resources. Seven water reduction projects were initiated in different factories locations. These initiaves, inter-alia, resulted in reduction in water consumption and reuse of recycled water in a more efficient manner. The projects undertaken will result in savings of approximately 148,654 m3 (saving of 5.31 % of total annual water consumption) and shall be realized in the next two to three years. One of the key initiatives contributing to water savings in 2022 was increasing the utilization of treated effluent after polishing through high technology Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant. Your Company will continue to work to achieve good water resources management throughout operations and agricultural supply chains. Your Company is supporting regenerative farming that aims to improve soil health and soil fertility, as well as protecting water resources and diversity. Further, your Company continued its projects, which in the long-term result into reduction of pollution and protection of the environment. The reduction continues to be driven at the material usage level and measured in value terms as well. During the year, below were the Key Performance Indicators (‘KPI’) which reflected reduction in the food loss and wastage, across value chain: •Zero Loss Material Variance: Excess usage/ wastage of materials in the production beyond the product manufacturing norms reflect the wastage/ in-efficiencies in the production process. •Obsolescence: The KPI’s with regard to material, which could not be used in the production, rendered products unfit for further use or expired before usage, were tracked to ensure minimal food wastage and monetary loss. •Bad Goods: The KPI’s with regard to finished goods, which reach end of life, due to various reasons including mismatch of demand and supply, were tracked to ensure that there is least amount of bad goods. •Zero Waste to Landfill: All factories are “zero waste to landfill”, which implies that all generated waste is either reused, recycled or co-processed and none of the packaging ends up in landfill or as litter in the environment. 177
